  <h3>Skills and fitness practice for players</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>These two basic tools are the most essential ingredients for any footballer’s success. Accuracy is the key when it comes to passing and receiving. It makes open play fluid and ensures constant progress up the field that can result in creating
      scoring opportunities.</li>
    <li>A simple drill is to shoot at a goal, targeting a very specific corner of the goal to hit the ball towards with each shot. I recommends a variation to this drill by adding a defender in a 1v1 situation so you further improve your skills for
      game situations.</li>
    <li>A player’s ball control can be critical in building up play, especially at the time of receiving the ball.</li>
    <li>Practice drills in which you have to control the ball with two touches; for example, passing drills in which you receive the ball from a partner and control it with one touch before passing it back with the second touch. Progress to
      practicing the drill with a single touch. Keepy-uppies are also useful in developing this skill.</li>
